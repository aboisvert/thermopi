# thermopi-server

The server module is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi (Pi Zero W).

The server performs several roles:

1) Web-based UI
2) Data collection and persistence
3) Temperature control (via HVAC)


## Implementation

The server is implemented using the [Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org) and the [Rosencrantz](https://github.com/andreaferretti/rosencrantz) web framework.
