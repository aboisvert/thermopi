Temperature Control state machine

Low-level (Allowable range)
===========================

Two inputs:
  1) Heating or Cooling mode
  2) Desired Temperature (e.g. 65F)

General logic:
- if heating mode and current temperature < desired, turn on heating
- if cooling mode and current temperature > desired turn on AC

Considerations:
- allow for hystheresis (+/- some degrees)
- allow for duty cycle limit (no on/off within X time period)


High-Level (Programming)
========================

Level 0: Manual Control
  - fixed desired low/high temperatures

Level 1: Weekday/Weekend scheduling, with up to 4 periods per day
  - separate schedules for heating (desired lows) and cooling (desired highs) modes
  - period override (resets at next period)
  - hold (stays until manually cleared)
  - optional: predict temperature response to achieve next period's constraint

Level 2: Smart modes
  - Holiday (override indefinitely)
  - Weekend away (override until Sunday 6pm)
  - Guests staying (?)
  - WFH (override until 6pm)

  - improvement is "override until X" function




Scrapped Ideas:

Low-level (Allowable range)
===========================

Two inputs:
  1) Desired Low Temperature (e.g. 65F)
  2) Desired High Temperature (e.g. 80F)

General logic:
- if current temperature < Desired Low, turn on heating
- if current temperature > Desired High, turun on AC
